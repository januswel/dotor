# dotor

dotfile setuper

## synopsis

- creates symbolic links to dotfiles in your home directory.

## usage

```sh
# creates symlinks in keeping with a setting file
dotor dotorrc /path/to/your/dotfiles/dir
```

## future works

- dry run
- (may) creates symlinks for well-known dotfiles without setting files
- (may) deletes symbolic links made by dotor from your home directory.
